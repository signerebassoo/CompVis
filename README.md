# Hybrid Images
The project generates a hybrid of two images by convolving the high- and low-pass versions of them. The resulting hybrid is an image where one of the two can be clearly identified when zoomed in and the other when zoomed out. The task has been carried out as part of coursework for Computer Vision at the University of Southampton and utilises [OpenIMAJ](http://openimaj.org/index.html) [1] Java libraries.
